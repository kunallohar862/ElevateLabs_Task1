in this file i have worked on stock market data this data consist of 4 index
* SPX
* DAX
* FTSE
* NIKKEI
I arbiraryly created missing values by deleting some data points in excel
and for handelling those missing values i applied 2 methods
* Foreward fill and Backward fill: it is commonly used in time series data which has large ammount of entries, this method fill the missing value with value just beside it, and vice-verca in Backward Fill
* Mean: mean, mode and median are also used to fill missing data points in a data set for this data set i used Mean to fill missing points. beacuse it is completly numbrical data then in this case mean just worked simply
